            <p> It has been over 10 years since the first version of Android was released.
              Over this span, Android continues dominating the mobile OS arena by taking 87% of the global share in 2019.</br>
              Its openness and innovation are the significant factors for many mobile device companies to adopt Android as their device OS.
              This contributes to wide range of devices with wide range in price too.  Hence, it makes Android devices more affordable.</br>
              Plus, Android has managed to catch up on the features that used to be dominated by iOS, such as voice assistant.
              With lower pricing and comparable features, Android devices become more attractive in the consumer eyes.

            <p> I considered myself to be late when Android got my attention.  I started working on Android development
            when I joined a start up company called <a href="https://www.cogosense.com">CogoSense</a> in 2015.</br>
            The company's product, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aegismobility.guardian&hl=en_CA">FleetSafer</a> is an application to prevent distracted driving.  This product line was built for Android and iOS.
            Since I am still amazed with Android, I will spend sometime covering FleetSafer for the Android device here.</br>
            I joined CogoSense since I was interested with the technology and its aspiration that is inline with mine, make the world better a bit a the time through technology.</br>
            Android provides the platform and technology for FleetSafer.  This application can use either location service with activity recognition or beacon via bluetooth low energy to detect movement.
            Android also provides the API for managing the call and notification.</br>
            Android's openness and technology allows FleetSafer to work at its potential and save lives on the road by reducing distracted driving.

            <p> Android devices are everywhere, especially in Asia.  The idea of creating <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dambeavertech.wowbday&hl=en_CA">WowBday</a> came to me when I visited Indonesia
              to see my dad for the last time.  On his last day, I made a promise to bring our family back together after 27 years of uneasiness and many misunderstandings between us.</br>
              I started making amend to myself and initiated the communications with my cousins, uncles and aunties.  We decided to set up a group on WhatsApp.  That is a major progress after 27 years of minimal communication between us.
              I jotted down everyone's birthday and made a tradition to send a birthday wish on our newly formed family channel. It showed an amazing result as everyone in the channel also jumped in to send birthday wish, just like a domino effect.
              Since I was the only one who kept tracking the birthday, mishaps happened and I missed few birthdays here and there.  Hence, I started thinking to share the responsibility to the rest of family member so that this new tradition
              of sending a birthday wish will keep alive.</br>
              I decided to create a simple application that post a reminder when there is a birthday and can send a birthday wishes easily with the provided template.
              This was how WowBday got created.</br>
              My decision to build this on Android was based on the fact that many of my family members uses Android more than iOS.
              The openness, the technology, and the wide range of Android help me to make the world better
              one bit at the time.  By the way, we finally managed to have a big family reunion and sit together
              as a family.  One birthday wish at the time to heal all the wounds.
