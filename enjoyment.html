            <p> Over the course of my career, I have done numerous type of software tests from unit test to system integration test.  I found software testing is intriguing.
              I have met numerous software testers, and I notice these 4 characteristics define how good a software tester is:
              attitude, analytical, curiosity and organize.</br>
              <span style="color:blue">Attitude</span>, as software tester should have a drive to question everything, never believe in a bug free build.
              Testers should be able to put themselves in the user perspective.  Tester should never compromise on the quality
              and strive for the unlimited test till quality product has been achieved.</br>
              <span style="color:blue">Analytical</span>, this is a must.  Strong analytical skill is required for capturing user requirement and strategize the test.
              <span style="color:blue">Curiosity</span>, testers should have strong curiosity.  They should test to break.  Negative testing is as important as Positive testing.</br>
              <span style="color:blue">Organize</span>, a well organized tester plans ahead, s/he starts early and does not wait till the build completed to start testing.  They start with user requirement early and
              being diligent on documentation.  They can generate a complete documentation on their testing.

            <p> Software tester has to be able to capture user requirement, strategize the test plan and deliver the test result.
              One of the testing technique is by using Software Decision Table Testing.  This table provides an approach where tester
              can see the input and the output of test cases.  This strategy will provide a comprehensive test coverage.  The example here is
              the test cases on a mobile application to solve issue with distracted driving.  The test cases can be broken down as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Case #1</span>, car is moving and device home screen is active, application curtain screen should be active to block user- device interaction</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Case #2</span>, car is moving and device lock screen is already active, application will not do anything since device is already in the safe mode</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Case #3</span>, car is stationary and device home screen is active, user has access to the device since car is stationary</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Case #4</span>, car is stationary and device lock screen is already active, user has to unlock device to gain access to the device</li>
